"4 chairs + 1 table = $1020 * ", advertised the banner.
How strange! "What does * refer to", asked Tommy.

I am in lesson 12 out of 13 lessons. That's almost 100%.
I've done +/- 96 exercises as there are 8 in each lesson.
dolores likes dollars as rosa likes roses as joel likes jokes
Each timed exercise lasts at least 3 minutes but most take 5-10 minutes.
Lesson duration is usually 45 minutes.
All in all, I have spent almost 540 minutes (12*45 minutes) typing.
That's only 9 hours in 2 weeks.
I started with "hunt and peck" typing with net speed 18 WPM and 85% accuracy.
My target net speed was 30 WPM, that's 200 KMP.
Learning the positions of 26 letter keys, 10 number keys and almost 20 punctuation marks.
I've exeeded my target speed by 15% and now type 35 Words per Minute!
And my accuracy is not 95% but 98% -- that's great!
After continuing to practice for another 2-4 weeks, I'm sure to reach 45 WPM.
After 2 months... 60 WPM. That's a promise!
"How much is 63% of 600?" Bethany asked her father at 5 in the evening.
"Let me think... 600/100=6*63=378. 378. Why do you ask?"
"Because a bike is on sale. And not just any old bike but the 4x765z-Styler!"
Can I get one for my birthday?" she pleaded.
"We'll see, 63% is quite a big reduction." her father replied.
6+3+6+3=18, 6+6+6=18, 3*6=18, 9*2=18, 9+9=18, 6/2=18
"There are so many ways to get to one number!" screeched James.
(4*3)+(2*3)=18 and 25-7=18
Since Mom gave me $18 for Christmas I only have to save 3*18 more, i.e. $54
To reach the $72 I need for that second-hand console!
It is really quite simple and it shouldn't cost you more than $4. Could you bring 2 to the bake sale?
According to my calculations that star is about 17,453,516,182,789.25 miles from Earth.
That other one we discovered last month is only 2,495,018,874,109.74 miles away.
We are running out of money though.
We cannot search for new stars until our research funding for the next 20 years is guaranteed.

Did you know that the burnished-buff (rufous-crowned) tanager is a bird?
What's yours?" asked the strange pinkish creature.
A creature popped into my bedroom one night.
"12" I said. And the creature rolled his eyes 24 times.
